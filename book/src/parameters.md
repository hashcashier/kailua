# Parameters

Before migrating to Kailua, you'll need to decide on a few setup parameters and note them down for later use during
the migration process.

## Starting Block Number
You'll need to pick a block number for Kailua to start sequencing from.
The sequencing state according to your `op-node` at the block you pick will be immediately finalized.
When you choose to enable withdrawal against Kailua sequencing proposals, your users will be able to start withdrawals
using this finalized state.

```admonish tip
You can postpone enabling withdrawals using Kailua at any later point in time after successful migration.
```

## Proposal Block Span
Each sequencing proposal in Kailua must cover a fixed number of L2 blocks, which will determine how much data must be
published per proposal.
Consequently, this parameter will determine your proposer's DA costs for using Kailua.

```admonish note
The current implementation does not yet support mutli-block fault proofs, which means that proposals will have to
publish a commitment per covered L2 block in the proposal.
```

These commitments are published as Blobs, which means you should optimize your block span `S` to be `S = B * 4096 + 1`,
where `B` is the number of blobs required for a single proposal transaction (Ethereum currently limits a single block to
at most 6 blobs, i.e. `B < 7`).

Subsequently, combining `S` with your rollup's block time determines how often your sequencer has to publish a proposal
to ensure the liveness of your chain.

```admonish example
Consider Optimism Mainnnet as an example, which has a block time of 2 seconds.
To keep its current average sequencing frequency of ~55 minutes, it only needs to publish ~1650 commitments per proposal.
To maximize the utilization of the extra blob published when proposing, OP Mainnet can relax its proposal rate to once
per 2 hours and 15 minutes.
```

## Proposal Time Gap

Because Kailua is designed for permissionless sequencing, it has an extra safety mechanism that can prevent sequencing 
proposals from being made eagerly before the parent chain data supporting that state is finalized.

This mechanism comes in the form of a forced delay between the timestamp of the L2 block being proposed, and the current
timestamp on the parent chain (ethereum).

At the time of writing, Ethereum finalizes each block in [approximately 15 minutes](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/single-slot-finality/#:~:text=It%20takes%20about%2015%20minutes%20for%20an%20Ethereum%20block%20to%20finalize).
Consequently, we recommend you set this parameter to `15 Ã— 60 = 900` seconds to match.

```admonish note
While the Kailua proposer agent won't publish a sequencing proposal until it is considered safe, the Kailua contracts
allow you to enforce this requirement so that even an eager (potentially dishonest) proposer cannot have a head start!
```

## Collateral Amount

The collateral requirements for a sequencer in Kailua come in the form of a fixed amount to be deposited, independent of
how many sequencing proposals are in flight.
This is because a malicious Kailua proposer, and any faulty sequencing proposals it has published, is eliminated using
only a single fault proof.

The prover who submitted that fault proof consequently gets compensated with the faulty sequencer's staked collateral.
This collateral should at least cover the proving cost, but should also include a sizeable tip for the prover to
incentivize proving priority.
Our estimates put a worst-case proving cost using Bonsai for a single (OP Mainnet) block at $100 USD.

```admonish example
Currently, OP Mainnet requires 0.08 ETH (\~$300) of collateral per proposal, and finalizes a proposal after at least 3.5
days if it is undisputed.
This means, at an average hourly rate of proposing, the proposer has `84 * 0.08 = 6.72` ETH (\~$3700 USD) on average 
locked up as collateral in the best case where no disputes take place.

Using Kailua, 0.08 ETH would be sufficient as the total collateral locked up by the proposer, even under the same finality
delay.
This would cover the worst-case proving cost in case of dispute, and, discounting transaction costs, leave a $200 tip.
```

## Challenge Timeout

The current implementation of Kailua does not yet have adaptive dispute periods based on congestion.
Consequently, you should keep your existing challenge timeout period.

## Verifier Contract
RISC Zero maintains a set of pre-deployed verifier contracts for its ZK proving system.
These contracts are regularly upgraded to support new releases of the prover, and also have a permissionless fail-safe
mechanism that anyone who can produce a proof-of-exploit can trigger to halt the verifier.

```admonish note
You must ensure that the chosen verifier contract supports your RISC Zero zkVM version.
Once a new zkVM version is released, there can be a delay in adding it to the router.
```

You have the choice of either using the already deployed verifier for your parent chain, or deploying and maintaining
your own verifier contracts, as described in the later sections.

```admonish success
Once you've got your parameters all planned out, you're ready for the next step!
